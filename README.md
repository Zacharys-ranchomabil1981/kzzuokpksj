Dude, just walked outta Raid 2, and holy crap, my brain is mush — like overstirred oatmeal with a side of oh-my-god-did-that-really-just-happen. Can't even find a coherent thread to pull from. Still feeling the seat vibrating from the last fight scene; it’s like my body's a tuning fork after a rock concert, but with punches. My back aches like I was the one thrown through a window and not just sitting bewildered for two hours (felt like five).

Bits of popcorn are lodged in my shoes; should write a review about how sticky movie theater floors are a metaphor for life — so persistent and annoying. Jesus, speaking of sticky, that final fight in the kitchen! Knives and bodies moving like a blender on full speed, blood painting the room like a Jackson Pollock. Seriously, it’s as if the Matrix and a Tarantino movie had a baby, and then handed it a pair of knives to play with. 

> Every punch was like a mini earthquake in the theater; even the air felt heavy when it went silent. Sometimes I forgot to breathe, like holding your breath when you’re skipping through scary YouTube videos except you're glued ‘cause the stakes are just... massive. Yeah, stick an action movie in the blender of chaos and add twice the shots of espresso. Didn't somebody say I should watch the movie with an IV drip of adrenaline? I get it now. I really do.

There was this prison riot scene — wasn’t it like a grimy, brutal water ballet? Remembering someone telling me to download the movie, but nothing compares to seeing that insanity on the big screen. My brain’s bubbling like an over-boiling pot full of half-cooked plotlines and “did that happen?” moments. Then those muddy fields, chaos raining from the skies — those raindrops weren’t water; they were like punches. And me, trapped in the storm with stale popcorn breath and no umbrella.

And don't even get me started on the corridor fights, and the soundtrack pounding like someone trying to sledgehammer a beat into my subconscious. Speaking of sound, the couple next to me — argue-whispering about popcorn prices mid-car chase. Felt like trying to concentrate on a book while a hurricane howls next door.

Can’t think. Must rethink. Should I watch the movie again when my brain comes down from the Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride of cinema? You know, the sort of ride where you're pretty sure you left your sense of reality behind on the second loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int epicKick(int impact) {
   int recoveryTime = 0;
   while (impact--) {
      recoveryTime += (impact % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2);
   }
   return recoveryTime;
}
// did I just paste this again? 
```
